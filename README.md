# My-first-repository-form
This is my first project on GitHub

Made a simple form in front end with a backend api with all CRUD elements.
Work is still in progress, will develop more in free time, do more pages where i can implement Angular, jQuery and boothstrap.
I know some pratics are the not the best, also some identifications, but it's working.
Feel free to help me development, im open to all kind of solutions.
