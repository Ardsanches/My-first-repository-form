# Simple Form with Full CRUD REST API
This is my first full-stack project on GitHub, a simple frontend form connected to a RESTful backend API implementing full CRUD operations.

**Tech**
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/Javascript (basic form)
- Backend: .NET Core Web API with Entity Framework
- Database: SQL Server
- Others: Swagger for API testing

**What it Does**
- Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations via REST API
- Functional connection between frontend and backend
- Demonstrates full-cycle development: from backend logic to API integration

**Future Improvements**
Expand frontend with:
Angular components
jQuery enhancements
Bootstrap styling
Improve code structure and naming conventions
Host and deploy for live demo

**Notes**
This is a work in progress. I'm constantly learning and improving (feedback is always welcome!).
Feel free to fork, open issues, or suggest improvements. I'm open to collaboration and new ideas.

**About Me**
Iâ€™m a future web developer with a passion for learning, problem-solving and building real-world projects. Looking for opportunities to grow in the tech field and face new challenges.
